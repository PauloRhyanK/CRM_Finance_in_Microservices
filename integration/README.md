# Integration Tests Documentation

This directory contains integration tests for the TCC microservices project. Integration tests are designed to verify that different services work together as expected.

## Structure

- **Test Cases**: Each test case should be organized in a way that reflects the services being tested. 
- **Test Framework**: Specify the testing framework being used (e.g., pytest, unittest).
- **Setup and Teardown**: Include any necessary setup and teardown procedures for the tests.

## Running Tests

To run the integration tests, use the following command:

```bash
# Example command to run tests
pytest tests/integration
```

Ensure that all services are running before executing the tests.

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new test file for each service or feature.
2. Use descriptive names for test functions.
3. Document the purpose of each test within the code.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install any dependencies required for running the tests. Check the `requirements.txt` files in the respective services for specific dependencies.

## Notes

- Integration tests should cover critical paths and interactions between services.
- Regularly update this documentation as new tests are added or existing tests are modified.
